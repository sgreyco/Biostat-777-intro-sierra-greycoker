Students generally study for exams in a variety of ways, using many different resources. In a UMBC differential equations course, students were surveyed (pictured below) to better understand how they prepared for their first course exam.


![Blank Survey](Survey-Questions.png)


The goal of this analysis is to answer the questions:

  - What resources do students generally use to prepare for an exam?
  
  - Which of these resources are most effective?


## Audience
The analysis is directed towards differential equations students and professors.

## Data Cleaning
Most of the data cleaning involved correcting the data types of each of the variables. Exam scores were relocated in order for easier grouping of predictors later in the analysis. One variable, PREPARATION, was renamed to BEFORE, for better contrast against the variable AFTER. Finally, only three  observations had missing data, so those three were removed.


::: {.callout-tip title="Libraries"}
Packages used were tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, patchwork.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Exam scores
The exam scores were centered around 78 with an interquartile range of 34.5 points. With a minimum score of 21 aqnd the first quartile at 60.25, the distribution skewed left.

While most students felt "mostly prepared" going into the exam, the sentiment changed after the exam. Many students then felt "not so good". 

```{r}
#| label: fellings-dists
#| fig-show: hold



ggp1 <- plt + 
  aes(BEFORE) +
  stat_count()+ 
  labs(
    x = "Before"

    x = "After"

  plot_annotation(
    title = "Feelings before and taking the exam",
    subtitle = "Students generally felt less confident after taking the exam.",
    caption = "Fig. 2" 
  )
```


However, after seeing their score, most students reported doing did better than they expected.

```{r}
plt +
  aes(FELT) + 
  stat_count() +
  labs(
    title = "How students felt after seeing their scores",
    subtitle = "Generally student felt the performed at least as they had expected. Interestingly, most students \nperformed better than they expected after the exam.",
    x = "Feeling after seeing score",
    caption = "Fig. 3"
  )
```




#### Resources utilized

I was particularly interested in the number of resources students used to prepare for this exam and what those resources were. 

Students had seven resources available to them: 

  (1) Professor office hours,
  
  (2) TA office hours,
  
  (3) Individual appointments,
  
  (4) Study groups,
  
  (5) Textbook examples,
  
  (6) Posted videos, and
  
  (7) Emailing for HW hints/verification.
  
  
Most only used two options none used more than five.

::: {.column-margin}
```{r}
#| Label: score-statistics

res_stats <- summary(survey$tot_res)
```

**Total Resources**

|  Stat   |      Value       |
|---------|------------------|
| Min     | `r res_stats[1]` |
| 1st Qu. | `r res_stats[2]` |
| Median  | `r res_stats[3]` |
| Mean    | `r res_stats[4]` |
| 3rd Qu. | `r res_stats[5]` |
| Max     | `r res_stats[6]` |

:::


```{r}
plt +
  aes(tot_res) +
  stat_count() +
  labs(
    title = "Total number of resources used",
    subtitle = "Most students used two of the available resources. ",
    x = " Number of resources",
    caption = "Fig. 4"
  )
```

The group using two resources had the largest spread of scores, while the group using three resources had the smallest (ignoring the one student who used nothing and the one student who used five resources). Perhaps to be expected, the student who used five resources scored the highest on this exam.

```{r}
#| message: false



ggp1 <- plt +
  aes(x = tot_res, y = SCORE) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Number of resources used",
    y = "Score",
  )

ggp2 <- plt +
  aes(x = as.factor(tot_res), y = SCORE) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    x = "Number of resources used",
    y = "Score",
  )

(ggp1 + ggp2) +
  plot_annotation(
    title = "Distribution of scores based on number of resources used",
    subtitle = "Of the groups with more than one student, the group with 2 resources had the greatest spread, \nwhile the group with 3 resources had the smallest.",
    caption = "Fig 5." 
  )



```

# Which resources were used most?



## Results

Students who used more resources to prepare for their exam tended to perform better. Across the board though, students may be underestimating their performance immediately after the test, as evidenced by most students scoring higher than they thought they would.
